# Script to selectively delete tweets and favs

This script deletes all tweets and/or favs of a Twitter account. I borrowed heavily from [this post](https://www.mathewinkson.com/2015/03/delete-old-tweets-selectively-using-python-and-tweepy) for this script. 

## Requirements

* A Twitter developer account. You can aaply for one [here](https://developer.twitter.com/en/apply/user.html).
* A file named ```keys.py``` containing the credentials of your developer account:

```python
API_KEY='XXXXXXXXX'
API_SECRET='XXXXXXXXXX'
ACCESS_TOKEN='XXXXXXXX'
ACCESS_SECRET='XXXXXXXXXXX'
```

* The ```tweepy``` python library

## Use
